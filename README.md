# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

Here is an employee profile generator application.

The application can be ran by opening the index.js file in the "intergrated terminal"(right-click file to see this option).

Node and inquirer will handle the responsibilites of this application when the command "node.index" is entered in the terminal.

You will be prompted with a series of questions that can be customized based on the output that you would like to experience.

The final html page will be created for you.

This file can be found in the directories "output" folder and ran on your desired browser.

Feel free to have fun and make edits if needed.
